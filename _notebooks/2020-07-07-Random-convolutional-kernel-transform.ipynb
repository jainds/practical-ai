Webb. The paper presents a unique methodology to transform time series data using convolutional kernels in order to improve classification accuracy. This paper is unique in learning from recent success of convolutional neural networks and transferring it on time series datasets. \n\nThe link to download the paper from arxiv - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13051)\n\n\n\n## Time Series data\n\nTime series data is defined as set of data points containing details about different point in time. Generally time series data contains data points sampled/observed at equal interval of time. Time series classification can be imagined as identifying patterns and signals in time series data in relation to respective classes. \n\nAuthors in this paper are promising fast and accurate time series classification. they propose that generating features using randomly generated kernels on time series data results in much btter accuracy.\n\n## Kernels\n\nKernels in simple terms is a small matrix used to modify the images. Let's try to understand kernels using an example: \n\nhere is a 3 x 3 kernel used to sharpen images: \n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 5 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0  \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nIn order to sharpen an image using above kernel, we need to perform a dot product of each pixel in image with the kernel matrix. The resulting image would then be a sharpened version of original image. Observe the gif below to see a live version of kernel dot product in motion. \n\nFollowing is an example from setosa.io site to demonstrate how kernels can change the images. \n\n### 5 parameters of kernels\n\nA kernel has 5 different parameter using which it can be configured. \n- Bias\n\n     A fixed value that is summed with the dot product result is called as the bias value\n     \n- Size\n    \n    Size defines the number of rows and columns a kernel has. The above example has a size of 3 rows and 3 colums\n    \n- Dilation\n- Weights\n- Padding\n\n\n## Global max pooling\n\n## Proportion of positive values\n\n## how does Rocket work and how to use it? \n\n## Rocket v/s others\n\n### Rocket v/s neural nets\n### Rocket v/s CNN\n\n## Rocket results\n### Accuracy\n### Time taken to train\n\n## Example\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
