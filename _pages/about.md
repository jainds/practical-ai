Hi there, Welcome to Piyush.Dev 

I am a data scientist who enjoys playing with new technologies and identify possible use cases in the real world.

I am an engineer by qualification, turned to data science by sheer nature of curiosity.

I like learning new things and sharing here.

Welcome to my site.
